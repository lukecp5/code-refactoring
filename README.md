# Code Refactoring
This is the first session's homework assignment repository

It contains the index of the Horiseon landing page, as well as the styles and images that it requires. I cloned the repository from our class's GitLab page, and then made
the requested changes to the files. 

This website offers information about a fictional internet marketing agency. It is now more accessible and fully functioning.

# Changes: 
- Fixed Accesibility Issues
- Fixed Hyperlinks
- Changed the elements to be more semantic
- Consolidated CSS to make it less cluttered
- Commented the CSS file thoroughly
