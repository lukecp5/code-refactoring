## Code Refactoring
This is the first session's homework assignment repository. The website offers information about a fictional internet marketing agency. It is now more accessible and fully functioning. It contains the index of the Horiseon landing page, as well as the styles and images that it requires. I cloned the repository from our class's GitLab page, and then made the requested changes to the files.
